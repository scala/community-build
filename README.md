# Scala Community Build

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/scala/community-builds](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/scala/community-builds?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This repository contains configuration files that enable us to build and test
a corpus of Scala open source projects together using Lightbend's
[dbuild](https://github.com/lightbend/dbuild).

**How big is it?**
It's **3.2 million lines** of Scala code, total,
from **188 projects** (as of November 2018),
and takes about **15 hours** to run.

**Why do this?** The main goal is to guard against regressions in new
versions of Scala (language, standard library, and modules). It's also
a service to the open source community, providing early notice of
issues and incompatibilities.

**Can I run it myself?** Sure, just clone the repo and run `./run.sh`.
