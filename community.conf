//// about spaces

// we have these spaces:
// - scala
//   - scala.main
//     - scala.main.jawn_0_10
//     - scala.main.jawn_0_11
// the jawn split is because sbt 1 uses jawn 0.10.x (via its dependency
// on sjson-new) and the sbt team doesn't want to break  binary compatibility
// of sbt plugins. nearly everything else is on jawn 0.11, and the two versions
// are source-incompatible.
