// dependency of giter8
// forked May 2018 because giter8 uses a version (2.1.2) that's source-incompatible.
// so we forked off the release-2.1.4 tag.
// our fork also has a commit to use a dbuild-friendly sbt-bintray version.
// (I submitted that change upstream, to master, but having it on master doesn't help us here.)
