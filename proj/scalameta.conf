// on 2.12.x, we're leaving fastparse(1)+scalapb+scalameta+scalafix+scalafmt all frozen
// forked off v4.0.0-M11 since that's what scalafix currently (Sep 2 2018) expects
// our fork includes Jason's 2.12.7 changes (which have probably since been merged
// upstream) and some JDK 11 friendliness changes.

// fork adjusted (August 2024) for JDK 23
