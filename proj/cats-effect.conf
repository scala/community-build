// Note that we are on Cats Effect 2 (series/2.x).
// Cats Effect 3 is the new hotness. We didn't upgrade right away,
// because we were waiting for downstream repos to upgrade, but
// enough time has now passed (August 2021) that switching to 3
// is plausible. This would allow unfreezing a bunch of downstream
// repos, many of which have a comment in their .conf files
// (`git grep CE` and `git grep -i cats.effect` will find most or
// all of those comments).

// Regardless: the whole picture will change once #1456 ("radically simplify
// the build") goes through.  Once we no longer have a monorepo-style
// build, it will be easy to switch to CE3 (and even keep CE2 as well, if we
// want).
