// there is a known issue with this repo where on JDK 13 and 14, on both
// MacOS and Linux, the JVM often segfaults when running the test suite.
// I reported the problem upstream here:
//   https://github.com/alexarchambault/scalacheck-shapeless/issues/149
// it happens often enough that I'm tempted to just disable the test suite.
