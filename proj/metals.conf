// though if we want to unfork, we'll have trouble because at present
// (19 Feb 2023) metals is on scalameta 4.7.1, whereas here in the
// community build we only have 4.6.0, because that's what scalafix
// expects. see https://github.com/scalacenter/scalafix/pull/1725

// note that there are always test failures when we run on a PR validation
// snapshot. (we could probably fix it by adding a resolver in the repo?)
