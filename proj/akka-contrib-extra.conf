// this was added because conductr-lib's Play integration depended on it,
// but we ended up not including that integration (for now anyway?), so
// nothing depends on this.  leaving it in since we might as well, but
// if it acts up, it can go.
// forked (December 2016) to get rid of the usual bintray-sbt stuff that
// makes dbuild upset. note that as of December 2018 we no longer build
// conductr-lib, so that's another reason this can go if it ever acts up.
