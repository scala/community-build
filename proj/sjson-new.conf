// frozen (May 2020) at last known-green commit. newer commits use sbt-jarjar-abrams
// to shade jawn-parser and I spent over an hour trying various things trying to
// adapt to that (like we already did with shaded-scalajson) but failed.  it's probably
// possible but it was turning into a time sink.

// addendum: at https://github.com/scala/community-build/pull/1162 Eugene has an idea for an
// adjustment to sbt-jarjar-abrams that might help
