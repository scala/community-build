// downstream projects expecting a different jackson version than the
// one we have here are prone to errors such as:
// com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException:
//   Scala module 2.8.8-dbuildx1c5888e4b2a136333f7edb02dbe6dc5abbfa7de1 requires Jackson Databind version >= 2.8.0 and < 2.9.0
// for details on how this can happen, see comments on
// https://github.com/scala/community-builds/pull/785
// 2.13: forked for 2.13.0-RC1 compat, we should be able to unfork once they publish for RC1
