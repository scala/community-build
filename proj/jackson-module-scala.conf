// https://github.com/scalacommunitybuild/jackson-module-scala.git#community-build-2.13  # was FasterXML, jackson-module-scala-2.12.0

// head of `2.12` branch has a SNAPSHOT dependency, so use a release tag

// but then we're forked (December 2020) from the jackson-module-scala-2.12.0 tag to
// pull in various fixes, some of which may have been merged on the 2.12
// branch, others maybe only on master?  but it's fine to stay forked

// before considering unforking, check the status of
// https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala/issues/431
