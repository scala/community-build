// https://github.com/scalacommunitybuild/fs2.git#community-build-2.13  # was typelevel, was ed522228910d498a2f0b31ae03470352196cc51a, was main

// note that this repo has required JDK 11 for building (since January 2020)

// frozen (August 2020) at a commit just before Dotty support was added, because
// "Missing dependency: the library ch.epfl.lamp#dotty-library is not provided"
// because the repo started defaulting to Dotty; not sure why it's happening,
// didn't investigate, it can wait until we need to unfreeze or until the same
// error starts happening in more repos (currently: ip4s, fs2)

// forked (October 2020) from ed522228910d498a2f0b31ae03470352196cc51a
// freeze point to bump sbt-osgi version for JDK 15. upstream's
// main branch already has the fix
