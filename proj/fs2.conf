// note that this repo has required JDK 11 for building (since January 2020)

// frozen (August 2020) at a commit just before Scala 3 support was added, because
// "Missing dependency: the library org.scala-lang#scala3-library is not provided"
// multiple repos are affected -- as of November 2020, five repos.  at some point
// we'll need to investigate, but I think it makes sense to wait until the general
// upheaval in Typelevel repos around Scala 3 upgrades has settled down

// forked (October 2020) from ed522228910d498a2f0b31ae03470352196cc51a
// freeze point to bump sbt-osgi version for JDK 15. upstream's
// main branch already has the fix
