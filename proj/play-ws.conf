// playframework and play-ws tend to get a bit out of sync with each other so it's generally better
// to have play-ws frozen at tag, unless it's forked.
// right now (May 2019) we're frozen at a May 2019 commit before some source-incompatible changes;
// see https://github.com/scala/community-builds/issues/912
