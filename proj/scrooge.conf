// there's also a "develop" branch, but I've found it to be prone
// to have SNAPSHOT dependencies we can't resolve

// frozen June 2024 because:
// [scrooge] [error] sbt.librarymanagement.ResolveException: Error downloading com.twitter:util-validator-constraints_2.13:24.5.0
// in the past such errors have sometimes resolved themselves
// later, so we might try unfreezing in a few months
