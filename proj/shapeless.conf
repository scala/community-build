// https://github.com/scalacommunitybuild/shapeless.git#community-build-2.13  # was milessabin, master

// frozen (January 2020) at a known-green January 2020 commit, from before a
// change broke case-app downstream

// and then forked (May 2020) because we changed `Symbol#toString`. shapeless master
// has the needed tweaks, but if we unfreeze we lose support for symbol literals, which
// some downstream repos are still using.  so instead, we fork from the freeze point
// (which was b002655f5)
