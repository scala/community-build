// in the 2.13 build, we chose to drop scala-gopher from the build in order
// to move to the new scala-async.

// here in 2.12, not sure whether to do the same thing, or stay on old scala-async.
// it probably doesn't matter much either way, but I figure this way the overall
// diversity of what we're testing is greater. if scala-gopher moves to new scala-async,
// or if other projects start using new scala-async, we could rethink.
