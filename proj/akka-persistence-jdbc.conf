// at present (Dec 2019) on 2.12.x we're frozen at v3.5.2, but that
// version uses scala.xml.pull, which no longer exists in the scala-xml
// version we have here on the 2.13.x branch.  (we could also solve
// the problem by excluding ClasspathResources.scala, which is the only
// place the missing API is used; it's just a test)
//
// but on master the artifacts have already moved to com.typesafe.akka,
// so we freeze (December 2019) at a December 2019 commit a bit before
// that changed
