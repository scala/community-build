// organization changed to com.typesafe.akka. once the lagom repo
// updates their dependency to use the new org, we could probably
// unfreeze

// and then forked from that commit to upgrade to ScalaTest 3.1
// (because the usual way of overriding the dependency ran into
// trouble; see https://github.com/scala/community-build/issues/1072)
// (fork updated July 2020 for ScalaTest 3.2)
