// this is a big build with a ton of subprojects.  we needn't be shy
// about disabling fragile ones, ones with obscure dependencies we
// don't have, etc.  frozen (August 2019) at June 2019 commit,
// because: "library org.typelevel#discipline-specs2 is not provided",
// and to get it we'd need newer discipline which needs ScalaTest 3.1

// then forked (April 2022) to modernize kind-projector syntax
