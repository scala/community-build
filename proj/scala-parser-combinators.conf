// https://github.com/scalacommunitybuild/scala-parser-combinators.git#community-build-2.12  # was scala, 1.1.x

// forked (October 2020) to upgrade sbt-osgi for JDK 15. I could do it on the real
// 1.1.x branch but I'm loath to touch it, since 1.2.x is the one under active
// development
// adjusted (November 2020) for CharSequence changes in 2.12.13
