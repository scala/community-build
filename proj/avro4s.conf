  // in January 2020 we started getting some test failures (on a previously known-green commit)
  // that look to be because tests are sensitive to ordering. we didn't change the Scala SHA,
  // so I guess it's a behavior change in some upstream dependency. it seems unlikely to be
  // a Scala regression, so for 2.12 let's just disable the tests. perhaps we could do something
  // better on the 2.13.x branch?
