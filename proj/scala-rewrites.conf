// https://github.com/scala/scala-rewrites.git#82a063a7fefe91a13d0c3bf754c4a057cfb4c579  # was master

// frozen (April 2020) at a known-green commit before fix.RuleSuite
// started failing

// This project is unusual in that we build it using only binary
// dependencies, since the community build's scalafix version is too
// old and we can't upgrade it because it has too many dependencies.
// (And scala-rewrites is 2.12-only because it lives in
// sbt-plugin-land.)

// This is trickier-than-normal because semanticdb-scalac and
// scalafix-testkit are CrossVersion.full, so we have to override that
// to use older binaries, since binaries don't exist for Scala nightlies.
//
// (If those older binaries don't work, then we'll have to do
// something else, but in a way that's good because we can notify Olaf
// upstream that we changed something in Scala that's going to require
// changes to Scalafix.)
//
// Note the hardcoded version numbers below (2.12.11, 4.3.7, 0.9.13).
// They may need bumping when a new Scala 2.12.x release is published
// or when we advance the scala-rewrites SHA.  Maybe it's possible to
// somehow avoid that by computing the version numbers, but meh.
