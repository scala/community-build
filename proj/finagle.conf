// 2.11: (March 2020) we are freezing both twitter-util and finagle
// together at the last known green SHAs, since they keep drifting out
// of sync with each other, resulting in errors, and isn't worth
// investigating further or resolving in the 2.11 context

// there is a `develop` branch, but it requires a snapshot version of the scrooge sbt plugin,
// so we were tracking `master`
